# Adventures In Coding

Welcome to Adventures in Coding! 

This is a solution we are using to provide talking points during the technical interview. There is no right or wrong answer, so look through the projects and approach some (or all) of the code that interests you. 

Currently AIC is broken down into segments: Data, Functionality, Refactoring, Sorting, and tests. Inside each of the projects you will find some classes and methods to interact with. Some are not implemented, and some could use a little cleaning up. Take some time to implement the functionality, and refactor the functionality that could use some attention.

You can ignore the Fibonacci Sequence and Move Count functionality as that is something we were experimenting with ourselves, but found it to take too much time to discuss. And please note, this is a living project, so there could be changes in the works.

Again, this is not a test, just something that allows us to interact with your technical approach and gives us the ability to see how you approach problems. So have fun and enjoy it!
